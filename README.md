# Aim:
To create a comprehensive report for the design of a specific application, such as AI-powered 
chatbot/solar panel system/automation in manufacturing, using diverse prompt patterns. 
This report will employ scenario-based prompting techniques to guide each stage of the 
design process, ensuring the solution meets the functional and user experience 
requirements for the chosen application.
# Procedure:
1. Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Outline the purpose of the design, the target audience or user base, and its main objectives. 
Specify the goals the design aims to fulfill, such as user engagement/energy efficiency/task 
automation.
2. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Select appropriate prompt patterns to guide different aspects of the design. Examples of 
prompt patterns and their applications in the report include:
o Idea Generation Prompts: Brainstorm innovative features or functions the design 
should incorporate to meet specific goals.
o Persona and Context Prompts: Define the tone, style, or experience the design 
should convey (e.g., user-friendly/sustainable/reliable), aligning with the intended 
audience.
o Exploratory Prompts: Investigate resources or information essential for the design, 
such as user needs/environmental constraints/technical requirements.
o Refinement Prompts: Refine design elements by adjusting specifications, materials, 
or style to meet project standards.
o Scenario Testing Prompts: Simulate realistic scenarios or use cases to test the 
designâ€™s effectiveness and adaptability in user interaction/environmental 
settings/production workflows.
o Error Handling Prompts: Design prompts to handle potential issues or challenges 
effectively within the user interface/system functionality/automation processes.
3. Implementation Plan:
Describe the steps to build and implement the design, from system 
configuration/component selection/automation setup to testing and 
deployment/installation/integration.
4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection:
Use targeted feedback prompts to gather insights from users/stakeholders/operators, 
refining the design based on their input for improved functionality and alignment with 
objectives.

Documentation of Findings:
Summarize insights from each prompting technique, noting how they enhanced the design. 
Include any best practices, limitations, or future improvements
1. Define the Scenario and Use Case
Purpose: 
 To design a solar panel system tailored for urban homes, optimizing energy efficiency and reducing 
dependence on traditional energy sources. 
Target Audience: 
 Homeowners living in urban environments with limited roof space and a focus on sustainability. 
Objectives: 
 1. Maximize energy output in compact areas. 
 2. Ensure the system is affordable, durable, and requires minimal maintenance. 
 3. Incorporate smart monitoring to track energy production and usage in real-time. 
2. Prompt Pattern Applied: Scenario Testing Prompts
Objective:
To simulate various real-world scenarios and assess how the system performs under different 
conditions, ensuring it meets user requirements effectively. 
Prompt Example:
"Simulate the performance of the solar panel system in the following conditions: sunny days, cloudy 
weather, rainy weather, and peak evening energy consumption."
Insights from Testing: 
 Sunny Days: 
 - Maximum efficiency of 95%. 
 - Excess energy stored in the battery for later use. 
 Cloudy Weather:
 - Efficiency drops to 60%, highlighting the need for backup sources or increased storage. 
 Rainy Weather: 
 - Energy generation is minimal; reliance shifts to stored energy or external power sources. 

 Peak Energy Consumption (Evenings):
 - Stored energy meets 80% of the demand, requiring optimization for higher storage capacity. 
3. Implementation Plan
1. Component Selection: 
 - High-efficiency photovoltaic cells to optimize energy capture in limited spaces. 
 - Durable, weather-resistant materials suitable for urban conditions. 
 - Battery storage with scalable capacity to handle varying energy needs. 
2. System Setup: 
 - Modular design for easy installation and adaptability to different roof sizes. 
 - IoT-based monitoring system to provide real-time data on energy production, storage, and usage. 
3. Testing: 
 - Conduct performance tests under different weather and usage scenarios. 
 - Install pilot systems in select urban homes to collect user feedback. 
4. Deployment:
 - Roll out the system commercially, offering flexible packages based on household energy 
requirements. 
4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection
Targeted Feedback Prompts: 
Prompt Example 1:
 "How well does the solar panel system meet your daily energy needs in different weather 
conditions?"
 - Insights: Users appreciated high efficiency on sunny days but requested larger storage for 
prolonged cloudy or rainy periods. 
Prompt Example 2:
 *"How easy was it to monitor your energy usage using the smart tracking system?"* 

 - Insights: Users found the interface user-friendly but suggested adding notifications for low storage 
or maintenance needs.
